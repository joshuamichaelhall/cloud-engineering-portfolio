# Cloud Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I'm Josh\! I'm a former MSP founder transitioning to cloud engineering, combining 26 years of leadership experience with modern cloud technologies and programming skills.

## üéØ About Me

- **Background**: Founded and scaled an MSP to $250K revenue, now pursuing cloud engineering
- **Current Focus**: AWS Solutions Architect certification and building production-ready cloud solutions
- **Specialties**: Cost optimization, Python automation, infrastructure as code
- **Education**: Completed 9 backend courses (Ruby, Python, SQL, databases, OOP) - top 10% in Python/Ruby on Codewars

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1. [Multi-Cloud Cost Dashboard](./projects/01-multi-cloud-cost-dashboard/)
**Problem**: Companies struggle to track and optimize cloud costs across multiple providers  
**Solution**: Automated dashboard providing real-time cost analysis and optimization recommendations  
**Impact**: Designed to save 20-40% on cloud costs based on MSP client experiences  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Boto3, React, AWS Lambda, CloudWatch  
**Status**: In Development (August 2025)

### 2. [Security Automation Platform](./projects/02-security-automation-platform/)
**Problem**: Manual security audits are time-consuming and error-prone  
**Solution**: Automated security scanning with auto-remediation capabilities  
**Impact**: Reduce security audit time by 80%, improve compliance posture  
**Tech Stack**: Python, AWS Lambda, EventBridge, SNS, Terraform  
**Status**: Planned (September 2025)

### 3. [Serverless CI/CD Pipeline](./projects/03-serverless-cicd-pipeline/)
**Problem**: Traditional CI/CD infrastructure is expensive and complex  
**Solution**: Serverless pipeline with zero infrastructure costs  
**Impact**: Deploy with confidence while eliminating CI/CD infrastructure overhead  
**Tech Stack**: GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda, S3, CloudFormation  
**Status**: Planned (September 2025)

### 4. [Infrastructure as Code Framework](./projects/04-infrastructure-framework/)
**Problem**: Teams struggle with consistent, secure infrastructure deployment  
**Solution**: Reusable Terraform modules with security best practices built-in  
**Impact**: Deploy production-ready infrastructure in minutes, not days  
**Tech Stack**: Terraform, Python, AWS, Security scanning tools  
**Status**: Planned (October 2025)
