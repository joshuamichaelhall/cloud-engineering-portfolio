# ðŸš€ Cloud Engineering Projects

## Overview

This directory contains production-ready cloud engineering projects that demonstrate real-world problem-solving abilities. Each project is designed to showcase specific skills while addressing actual business challenges I encountered while running an MSP.

## Project Timeline

### August 2025
- **Project 1**: [Multi-Cloud Cost Dashboard](./01-multi-cloud-cost-dashboard/)
  - Status: In Development
  - Focus: Cost optimization, data visualization, serverless

### September 2025
- **Project 2**: [Security Automation Platform](./02-security-automation-platform/)
  - Status: Planned
  - Focus: Security scanning, auto-remediation, compliance

- **Project 3**: [Serverless CI/CD Pipeline](./03-serverless-cicd-pipeline/)
  - Status: Planned
  - Focus: Zero-cost CI/CD, blue-green deployments

### October 2025
- **Project 4**: [Infrastructure as Code Framework](./04-infrastructure-framework/)
  - Status: Planned
  - Focus: Reusable modules, security by default

## Common Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python (primary), Bash (automation)
- **AWS Services**: Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, IAM
- **IaC**: Terraform (primary), CloudFormation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, custom metrics
- **Security**: IAM least privilege, KMS encryption, security scanning

## Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure:

```
project-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Detailed project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/       # Architecture diagrams and ADRs
â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform/         # Infrastructure as code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Unit and integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ demo/              # Screenshots and demo materials
â””â”€â”€ docs/              # Additional documentation
```

## Business Impact Focus

Every project is designed with business value in mind:
- **Quantifiable ROI**: Each project shows potential cost savings or efficiency gains
- **Real-World Problems**: Based on actual challenges from MSP experience
- **Production-Ready**: Built with security, scalability, and maintainability in mind
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation for both technical and business audiences

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I'm demonstrating:
1. **Cloud Architecture**: Designing scalable, cost-effective solutions
2. **Automation**: Eliminating manual tasks through code
3. **Security**: Building with security best practices from day one
4. **Business Acumen**: Understanding the "why" behind technical decisions
5. **Communication**: Explaining complex technical concepts clearly
