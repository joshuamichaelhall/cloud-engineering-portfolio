# Multi-Cloud Cost Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

A comprehensive cost management solution that provides real-time visibility into cloud spending across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with automated optimization recommendations.

## 🎯 Business Problem

During my time running an MSP, I watched clients struggle with:
- Unexpected cloud bills (sometimes 300% over budget)
- No visibility into cost drivers across multiple accounts
- Manual cost optimization taking weeks of analysis
- Difficulty allocating costs to departments/projects

## 💡 Solution

An automated dashboard that:
- Aggregates costs across multiple cloud providers
- Identifies optimization opportunities in real-time
- Provides actionable recommendations with one-click fixes
- Tracks savings and ROI automatically

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
[Cloud Accounts] → [Cost APIs] → [Lambda Functions] → [DynamoDB] → [React Dashboard]
                                            ↓
                                   [SNS Notifications]
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.9
- **Framework**: Serverless (AWS Lambda)
- **APIs**: AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, GCP Billing
- **Database**: DynamoDB for time-series cost data
- **Queue**: SQS for processing optimization tasks

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18
- **UI Library**: Material-UI
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Deployment**: S3 + CloudFront

### Infrastructure
- **IaC**: Terraform modules
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + Custom Metrics
- **Security**: IAM roles, KMS encryption

## 📈 Results & Impact

### Projected Impact (Based on MSP Experience)
- **Average Savings**: 20-40% reduction in cloud costs
- **Time Saved**: 40 hours/month on cost analysis
- **ROI**: Typically pays for itself in 2 weeks

### Real MSP Client Examples
- Healthcare client: Saved $15K/month by identifying idle RDS instances
- SaaS startup: Reduced costs by 35% through right-sizing recommendations
- Manufacturing firm: Eliminated $8K/month in unused resources
